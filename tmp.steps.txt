- Start localstack (-d for detached mode)
localstack start -d

/!\ Anything configured in localstack by default is transient, and will be lost on restart/reboot.

- Activate the local venv
source c2pa-env/bin/activate

- Install `awslocal` if not available (preferrably in venv)

- Create a test user
awslocal iam create-user --user-name test
- Get the test user's access key
awslocal iam create-access-key --user-name test

Keep the result logged in the CLI, as they will help to set the proper env vars.
The result value `AccessKeyId` should be set to the env var `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.
The result value `SecretAccessKey` should be set to the env var `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

- Then you can run the setup script: python setup.py create-key-and-csr 'CN=John Smith,O=C2PA Python Demo'
(This will create two files that are "gitignored": `config.json` and `kms-signing.csr`).
