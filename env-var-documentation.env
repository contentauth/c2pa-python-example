# Documents environment variables used in the project.
# Documents noteworthy default values used in the example.
#
# Use development mode and localstack
RUN_MODE=DEV
# Usual default localstack endpoint
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/
# Pick a default AWS region
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# Test AWS User access key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=LKIA_ACCESS_KEY
#
# Test AWS User secret access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Test_User_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#
# ID of KMS key to use for encryption
KMS_KEY_ID=key_id
#
# Path to the certificate chain file
# (eg created using cat kms-signing.crt rootCA.crt > chain.pem)
# Steps described in the readme place the certificate chain
# in the root of this repository (default)
CERT_CHAIN_PATH=chain.pem
#
# Choose a server to get timestamps from
# Default fallback if not set is `http://timestamp.digicert.com`
# TIMESTAMP_URL=http://timestamp.digicert.com
#
#
# Settings for signing server: host and port to listen to
#
# APP_HOST_PORT is the port the server should listen to for requests
# APP_HOST_PORT = 5000
#
# APP_ENDPOINT is the IPv4 address the server uses as host to listen to
# APP_ENDPOINT = a.valid.ipv4.address
#
# To use the local test client Python app:
# Host port client should use (port the server listens to)
CLIENT_HOST_PORT=5000
# Endpoint client should contact (defaults to localhost for the example)
CLIENT_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1
# Protocol client should use
CLIENT_PROTOCOL=http
#
#
# To reuse existing certificates in dev mode:
# Certificates usage: USE_LOCAL_KEYS, PS256_PEM_PATH_PYTHON_EXAMPLE and
# PS256_PEM_PATH_PYTHON_EXAMPLE need to have values (contents) working together!
# Eg. the certificate you use should be part of the certificate chain you use.
#
# Uncomment following line to use provided test keys instead of KMS:
# USE_LOCAL_KEYS=True
#
# If you want to provide and use your existing certificate (PS256 algorithm),
# you need to have `USE_LOCAL_KEYS` set to `True`, and
# uncomment and set the file path value to the certificate:
# PS256_PEM_PATH_PYTHON_EXAMPLE=path_where_certificate_is_stored
#
# If you want to provide and use your existing certificate chain containing
# the certificate defined in `PS256_PEM_PATH_PYTHON_EXAMPLE`, you need
# to have `USE_LOCAL_KEYS` set to `True`, and uncomment the following line:
# CERT_CHAIN_PATH_PYTHON_EXAMPLE=path_where_certificate_chain_is_stored
